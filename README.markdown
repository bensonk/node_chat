This code started out as a demo for [node.js](http://tinyclouds.org/node "Node
JS").  I have taken it and added a little framework for chat commands,
including things like rolling dice, random choice of a number of options, and
changing your nickname. As it stands, it's probably suitable for a small group 
of people who work in the same office to use as a constant informal chat room 
for the office.  

To run it, you will need to have node.js installed 
(see ry's [node.js](http://github.com/ry/node) repository).  Once you have
node.js installed, you can fork or clone this repo and run the server like
this:

`$ /usr/local/bin/node server.js`
